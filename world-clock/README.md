# My World Clock Project 

The World Clock project allows users to view the current time in different cities worldwide. Users can select a city from a dropdown menu or choose their current location to see the local time. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the Moment.js and Moment Timezone libraries for accurate time zone conversions.
