                    <h3>Nairobi, city of wildlife</h3>
                    <p>
                        Known as the safari capital of Africa, Nairobi is an energetic, modern city that serves as a fascinating introduction to both wildlife and nightlife. Music clubs pulse with life, shops and markets bustle, and a m√©lange of restaurants will tempt your palate in this former Maasai watering hole.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Top sights include the Karen Blixen Museum, Giraffe Centre and the black rhinos of Nairobi National Park. The compact city center is safe to walk in and taxis make other areas accessible.
